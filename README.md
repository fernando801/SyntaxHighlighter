# Syntax Highlighter

This project uses Finite Automatas to Highlight the syntax of the following languages:

* C
* Python
* Racket

The program takes path to the folder containing the files to hightlight. And generates a <code>./highlihted</code> folder replicating the structure of the given folder and replacing each highlighted file for an .html file that you can open on your browser to view the highlihted code.
